/**
 * Level of detail: how much of a planet is drawn for how big it looks.
 *
 * A planet that fills the screen shows everything; one that is far away, or
 * shrinking off into the distance, would only show noise and cost frames for
 * detail nobody can see. Detail fades in between two sizes instead of
 * switching, so nothing pops.
 *
 * Sizes are the planet's radius on screen in dp:
 *
 * * **coarse** (always): the disc, its shading, a cap, a couple of patches;
 * * **medium** from [MEDIUM_FROM] to [MEDIUM_FULL]: the big features, the
 *   glow and the orbits around Earth;
 * * **fine** from [FINE_FROM] to [FINE_FULL]: the graticule, every coastline,
 *   craters, canyons, volcanoes and cloud on Mars.
